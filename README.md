# Chacha20-Poly1305

This is my implementation of the **ChaCha20** stream cipher, **Poly1305** Authenticator and an **AEAD** (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) that combines the two into one **ChaCha20_Poly1305** algorithm.

I wrote this for fun to learn how the cryptographic primitives work under the hood.
